# Bike-Rental-Prediction
PROBLEM STATEMENT

A bike rental is a bicycle business that rents bikes for short periods of time. Most rentals are provided by bike shops as a sideline to their main businesses of sales and service, but some shops specialize in rentals. Bike rental shops rent by the day or week as well as by the hour, and these provide an excellent opportunity for people who don't have access to a vehicle, typically travelers and particularly tourists. Specialized bike rental shops thus typically operate at beaches, parks, or other locations that tourists frequent. In this case, the fees are set to encourage renting the bikes for a few hours at a time, rarely more than a day. The objective of this Case is to predict the bike rental count based on the environmental and seasonal settings, So that required bikes would be arranged and managed by the shops according to environmental and seasonal conditions.
